                        <p>A truly consumer-centric storytelling engine. We lean on the power of all our creative ideas,
                            both client and agency to “find right” based on consumer reactions versus guessing and
                            having to be right with our opinions and subjectivity. The result? Powerful creative that
                            works born from the consumer up. We are a modern mix of traditional Madison Avenue thinkers
                            of yesterday and internet-centric storytellers of today who believe a social post can go all
                            the way to a Super Bowl commercial. So we pay equal respect to both.</p>

                        <p>We’re relentlessly focused on one thing: driving business results for brands. This means
                            having a deep respect and intimate knowledge of channels where consumers are spending their
                            time, and building modern planning, buying and analytics disciplines that drive consumers to
                            act. While the industry has been built on reach and efficiency, we’re upending the model, to
                            understand attention, relevance and results.</p>

                            specifically and differently to people based on who they are, by listening and
